### Scope
    JSK.dst

### Objective
    To unveil new era of surveillance system using Computer Vision Techs
### Goal
    To develop an advanced surveillance system based on existing camera system
    (Do not change system. To level up few cameras is possible)
    
### Requirement(Hardware)
    Image Processing Server: 
            Intel Xeon E5-2600V3/V4 12C/24T 2.2GHz 30M 9.6GT/s 105W
            16-DDR4 2133/1866/1600MHz ECC DDR4 SDRAM 128G
            240G SSD-2,6T SATA-3
            NVIDIA 1080 12G-4
    
### Architecture
    
    
### Techs
    1. 5~6 kinds of image processing engine
    2. to have one big server() real-time process frames for 10 cameras
    3. batch process
    4. network framework
    5. testbed
    6. 

### Deliveries
    1. Performance Test Program
    2. DLL
    3. Python Capsule
    4. Embed Watermark/Software Protection/Encryption
    5. Hide Important Info(Network Configuration, Network Model)
